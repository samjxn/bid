A "Bid Your Tricks" game! Bid Your Tricks is a modification of ["Up and Down the River"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell#Up_and_Down_the_River) (which is, in and of itself, a modification of ["Oh Hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell)).

Currently, this game just supports a scoreboard. Implementaion of a full correspondence game of Bid Your Tricks is on the roadmap.
